Person profiles are a collection of properties about the users behind the events. You can use these user properties to better manage, analyze, and control data. 

For example, you can create [filters](/docs/product-analytics/trends#filtering-events-based-on-properties) or [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) based on user properties, which can then be used to [create insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights), [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags), and more. 

By default, PostHog captures events with person profiles. You can change this to either `never` or `identified_only` in your JavaScript initialization's `process_person` option or in an event's `$process_person` property.
