1. `person_profiles: 'always'` _(default)_ - We include person profiles for all events
2. `person_profiles: 'never'` - We don't include person profiles on any event.
3. `person_profiles: 'identified_only'` - We only include person profiles for users with person profiles already created. This is triggered by calling functions like `identify()`, `group()`, and [more](/docs/product-analytics/identify#processing-person-profiles). Anonymous users won't get person profiles.

An example of an updated configuration looks like this:

```js-web
posthog.init(
    '<ph_project_api_key>',
    {
        api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
        person_profiles: 'identified_only'
    }
)
```
