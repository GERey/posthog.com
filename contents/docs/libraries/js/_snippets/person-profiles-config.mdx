1. `person_profiles: 'always'` _(default)_ - We capture person profiles for all events.

2. `person_profiles: 'identified_only'` - We only capture person profiles for users where they are already created. This is trigged by calling functions like `identify()`, `group()`, and [more](/docs/product-analytics/identify#processing-person-profiles). New anonymous users won't get person profiles.

3. `person_profiles: 'never'` - We don't capture person profiles and drop events from functions like `identify()`, `group()`, and [others](/docs/product-analytics/identify#processing-person-profiles) that try to do so. However, if a user distinct ID already has a person profile created, we count events as ones with person profiles.

An example of an updated configuration looks like this:

```js-web
posthog.init(
    '<ph_project_api_key>',
    {
        api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
        person_profiles: 'identified_only'
    }
)
```
