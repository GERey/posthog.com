People in PostHog represent users who do events. Every event has a `distinct_id` representing a person attached to it. Depending on your person profile processing configuration, these persons may also have profiles in PostHog you can view by clicking on the [People tab](https://us.posthog.com/persons). 

Person profiles and user properties enable:

- Filtering on user properties
- Merging identities across `distinct_id` values (i.e. merging an anonymous user with a logged in user)
- Cohort creation
- Feature flag targeting on user properties
- Tracking initial UTM values and referrers across anonymous and identified users

Beyond this, there are many use cases that don't require person profiles. Because events that don't process person profiles are cheaper for us to ingest, the pricing for these events is lower. Some examples:

- Tracking a marketing website
- B2C apps where users don't sign up or log in
- High volume API server events

For backward compatibility and to make sure we don't drop person information accidentally, processing events with persons is the default for configs without any option set. 

## Capturing person profiles

By default, PostHog captures events with person profiles. To change this in the JavaScript Web configuration, change the `person_profiles` config option with one of the three options:

1. `person_profiles: 'always'` _(default)_ - We include person profiles for all events
2. `person_profiles: 'never'` - We don't include person profiles on any event.
3. `person_profiles: 'identified_only'` - We only include person profiles when you call `posthog.identify()`. Anonymous users won't get person profiles.

An example of an updated configuration looks like this:

```js-web
posthog.init(
    '<ph_project_api_key>',
    {
        api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
        person_profiles: 'identified_only'
    }
)
```

Other SDKs and the API can pass the `$process_person_profile` property on events.

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_the_user',
    event: 'movie_played',
    properties: {
        $process_person_profile: 'never',
    },
})
```

## Viewing person profiles

Clicking on a user opens their profile and shows all their properties.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={personProfileLight}
    imageDark = {personProfileDark}
    alt="Person profile" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

- **Events** shows all the events a user has triggered, which you can search and filter to find specific events.

- **Recordings** shows all session replays a user has generated. Note this is subject to the retention policy of your plan, so users who haven't been active recently may have none.

- **Cohorts** shows all the cohorts a user belongs to.

- **Related groups:** shows groups (e.g. organizations, projects, and instances) a user belongs to.

- **Feature flags:** shows all feature flags that are enabled for a user.

- **History:** shows any manual changes that have been made to the user's profile.

## Deleting person data

- Select 'Persons' from the left-hand menu
- Search for the person via their unique ID. For example, their email
- Click on the person's ID
- Click 'Delete person' to remove them and all their associated data from the PostHog instance. You will be prompted to confirm this action.

## Deleting person data with the API

You can also delete persons data via the API. See the [Data Deletion docs](/docs/privacy/data-deletion) for more information.
